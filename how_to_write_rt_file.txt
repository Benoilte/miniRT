HOW TO WRITE A .rt FILE

◦ Each type of element can be separated by one or more line break(s).
◦ Each type of information from an element can be separated by one or more space(s).
◦ Each type of element can be set in any order in the file.
◦ Elements which are defined by a capital letter can only be declared once in the scene.
◦ Each element first’s information is the type identifier (composed by one or two character(s)),
	followed by all specific information for each object in a strict order.

		ELements that should be present only once in the scene:

Ambient lighting:

R,G,B colors in range [0,255] : 			255,255,255

Camera:

identifier: 												C
x,y,z coordinates of the view point : 						-50.0,0,20
3d orientation vector. In range [-1,1] for each x,y,z axis:	0.0,0.0,1.0
Horizontal field of view in degrees in range [0,180]: 		70

Light:

identifier: 									L
x,y,z coordinates of the light point: 			-40.0,50.0,0.0
the light brightness ratio in range [0.0,1.0]:	0.6
